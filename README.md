## Hi there, I'm Matteo - aka [bad][website] 👋

Don't look at my website, it sucks, I've been busy, busy and lazy. If you wanna see some things that I've done take a look around here on GitHub. For the past 3 years I've been working for YNAP designing and building a variaty of Online Flagship and now Luxory e-commerce like Moncler, Isabel Marant and Cartier. I'm passionate about performance and accessibility, I love vanilla JS, build tools and native web-components but I experiment with all of the latest and greatest frameworks. In my free time I practice calisthenics, I run and I play soccer.
Trying to give something back to the community with a couple of NPM packages and some PR here and there. Currently looking for new challanges 😁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fitness companion PWA _coming soon_
- 🌱 I’m experimenting with React + Recoil/Redux and UI libraries
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [detect-autofill](https://github.com/matteobad/detect-autofill)
- 💬 Ask me about vanilla web-components and performance oriented builds ❤️
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub, LinkedIn, Email even I'm shy
- 👯 I’m always looking for something new so don't esitate!
- ⚡ Fun fact: the new Cartier e-commerce is built with custom-element 😎
